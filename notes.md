## Kernel 
In computer science, the kernel is the core component of an `operating system`. It acts as a `bridge` between the computer's hardware and the software applications, managing essential resources like memory, CPU time, and input/output operations. The kernel is the first program loaded when the system starts and remains active until shutdown, ensuring smooth communication and coordination between hardware and software. 
### Types of Kernels:
1. Monolithic Kernel: All services run in a single large block of code in the same memory space. Example: Linux kernel.
2. Microkernel: Minimal set of services runs in the kernel, while others run in user space. Example: Minix, QNX.
3. Hybrid Kernel: Combines aspects of both monolithic and microkernel designs. Example: Windows NT, macOS.

## Device Drivers
Software that allows the OS and programs to communicate with specific hardware devices

## BIOS, 
which stands for Basic Input/Output System, is a firmware program that initializes your computer's hardware when you turn it on and helps load the operating system. It's essentially the first software that runs when a computer starts up, acting as a bridge between the hardware and the operating system.
