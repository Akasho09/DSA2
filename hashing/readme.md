## Hashing 
is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size value (hash code), usually for fast access and lookup in data structures like hash tables.

- synatx: unordered_map<KeyType, ValueType> mapName;

- ðŸ§  Basic operations: insert, access, delete ( student.erase(101);  )

Operation	            Time Complexity
Insert an element	        O(log n)
Delete an element by key	O(log n)
Access element by key	    O(log n)
Find an element by key      O(log n)
Update element by key	    O(log n)
Traverse the map	        O(n)
