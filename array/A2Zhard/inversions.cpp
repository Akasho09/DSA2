/*
You are given an integer n and a 2D array requirements, where requirements[i] = [endi, cnti] represents 
the end index and the inversion count of each requirement.

A pair of indices (i, j) from an integer array nums is called an inversion if:

i < j and nums[i] > nums[j]
Return the number of permutations perm of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1] such that for all requirements[i], 
perm[0..endi] has exactly cnti inversions.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
