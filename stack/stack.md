# stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed (LIFO) .
- syntax : stack<int>stk;


### Functions :
s.push(x)	Pushes element x on top of the stack
s.pop()	Removes the top element (no return value)
s.top()	Returns a reference to the top element
s.empty()	Returns true if the stack is empty
s.size()	Returns the number of elements in the stack
s.emplace(args...)	Constructs element in-place at the top
swap(s2)	Swaps contents with another stack


> 
complexity of all ops = O(1).
- ARRAYS : Address of ith Index = Base address + offset = Address of 0th Index + i Ã— (size of one element) => O(1) again.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Infix Notation (normal way we write math)
Operator is between operands
- Needs parentheses and precedence rules to avoid ambiguity

## 2. Prefix Notation (Polish Notation)
Operator comes before operands
- * + A B C
- No parentheses needed â€” order is unambiguous

## 3. Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN)
Operator comes after operands
- No parentheses needed, order is unambiguous

## Infix to Postfix conversion

ðŸ”¹ Rules for Conversion
1. We use a stack for operators and follow these rules:
- Operands (A, B, numbers, etc.) â†’ directly add to postfix result.

- Left parenthesis '(' â†’ push to stack.

- Right parenthesis ')' â†’ pop from stack until '(' is found.

- *Operators (+, -, , /, ^) â†’

   -  While stack is not empty and the top of stack has greater or equal precedence, pop and add to result.

   -  Then push the current operator.

- At the end â†’ pop all remaining operators from the stack into result.


## ðŸ”¹ Infix â†’ Prefix

1. Reverse the infix string
Example: (A-B/C)*(A/K-L) â†’ )(L-K/A(*)C/B-A(

2. Swap brackets
Change ( â†’ ) and ) â†’ (.
After swap: (L-K/A)*(C/B-A)

3. Convert the modified expression to postfix

Use stack & precedence rules:
If operand â†’ add to result.
If ( â†’ push.
If ) â†’ pop until (.
If operator â†’ pop from stack until you find lower precedence.
- Special: ^ is right associative â†’ pop while <=.
Others are left associative â†’ pop while <.
Example (L-K/A)*(C/B-A) â†’ postfix = LKA/-CBA/-*

4. Reverse the postfix result
Reverse string to get prefix.
Example: LKA/-CBA/-* â†’ *-A/BC-/AKL

## Post to Infix
ðŸ”¹ General Rule

1. Operands (a, b, x, â€¦) â†’ push directly into the stack.

2. Operators (+, -, , /, ^, â€¦) â†’ pop two operands from stack:
- First popped â†’ right operand
- Second popped â†’ left operand
- Form: (left op right)

3. Push the new expression back onto stack.


## ðŸ”¹Prefix â†’ Infix

1. Traverse the prefix expression from right to left.

2. Operands (a, b, x, â€¦) â†’ push directly into the stack.

3. Operators (+, -, , /, ^, â€¦) â†’ pop two operands from stack:

- First popped â†’ left operand

- Second popped â†’ right operand

- Form (left op right)

4. Push the new expression back.

5. At the end â†’ stack contains final infix expression.
